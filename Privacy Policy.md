# Privacy Policy

Updated - 2022, April 22nd

PackPack is a Discord Bot whose interface adapts to Users, Channels, and Servers according to their (voluntarily specified) needs. To provide customised services, it needs to collect some of its Users' data, if they want to use specific features. This is not a legally binding contract, simply a description of PackPack's data collection practices. These policies are subject to change, and will be updated if there is any such change.

## Terminology

* **Server** - The Discord server that the User and PackPack are in.
* **Developer** - The developer of Discord bot, PackPack. `MandarinSmell#8906 (460409259021172781)`.
* **User** - Anyone in a Server where PackPack is present, who is using the bot in a channel that it has Read Messages permissions in.
* **Moderator** - A user who has Manage Server permissions in a Server that PackPack is in.

## Access to Data

Data Access is restricted to the Developer, and will never be used for any purposes besides development, evaluation, or testing. User data will not be sold to any third party. It will not be shared by anyone besides the Developer, unless required by Law or a Terms of Service agreement. Users may request the Developer to show where their data is being stored, and what exactly is being stored. They may also request for their data to be deleted.

## Data Collected By Bot

The datapoints below will be collected by PackPack, and are critical for it to provide its features. Some of these datapoints will be deleted when the User stops sharing any Server with PackPack, while others will be stored till PackPack's End of Service.

* **User ID** - User ID is mandatory to enforce rate limits on the User. It is also needed to store any preferences of the User. These include their preferred output language and their desired prefix. Preference data is only generated in the table when the User voluntarily mentions their preferences, otherwise they will use the Server defaults.
* **Role ID** - PackPack is also used for regulating Booster Emoji and Booster Role services. To use this (optional) service, storing Role IDs of Booster Roles is mandatory.
* **Server ID** - PackPack needs to store Server Defaults, and Booster Roles in each Server. For these services, storing the Server ID is critical.
* **Channel ID** - PackPack also provides (optional) light moderation features. These include Monitoring of DMs (sent to PackPack), Scam Link Detection (in Channels), and Channel Permission Management. If a Moderator explicitly says they want to use these features, Channel IDs will be stored for the channels where these services are required.

Besides, these four categories of data, the bot will never store any data. Role IDs, Server ID, and Channel IDs are removed immediately from PackPack's database when it leaves a Server. User preferences are stored indefinitely, so as to sync them across servers.

## Rights to Opt-Out

Servers may use Moderation Features mentioned above, or they may not use them. Users can opt out of data collection at any time with `p!optout`. After this, the bot will not monitor any message from the User. However, bot won't recognize you once command is called. The Developer takes responsibility to ensure that a User's preferences are not collected after they opt out, and they will be removed from the database immediately.

## Underage Users

This Application and Bot follow [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and laws regarding Privacy strictly. If the Developer is informed with definitive evidence that a User is underage, they will remove all information stored about the User. Additionally, the User will be prohibited from using any of PackPack's services.

## Contact

For any types of questions regarding PackPack, you may contact the Developer, `@MandarinSmell`, on the [PackPack Support Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eb2NRCs9)
