# Privacy Policy

Using this application, also known as Discord Bot, PackPack, requires the collection of some user data. To use this bot, users need to agree that bot is allowed to collect user data and read or monitor user's messages in Discord.

## Terminiology

* **Server** - The Discord server where user and bot, PackPack are in
* **Developer** - The developer of Discord bot, PackPack, also known as `MandarinSmell#8906 (460409259021172781)`
* **User** - You and any people who are in the server
* **Moderator** - The user who has permission of managing the server where user is in

## Access to Data

Accessing data is only permitted to bot's developer, and will never be used for any other purposes than developing bot, and testing. Data won't be sold, provided, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement.

## Data Collected By Bot

Items below will be collected by bot for maintaining bot's performance. Some of them will be stored temporarily as long as bot can reach user, while others will be stored permanently (until developer decides to stop maintaining the bot)

* **User ID** - User ID is stored to make bot able to memorize the situation when user spammed command, the preferences of this user such as locale, prefix, etc.
* **Role ID** - Role ID is stored for role system. Role system is for making only users who have specific role assigned able to use specific commands. It will be also used to perform booster-only perks (`p!boosteremoji`, `p!boosterrole`)
* **Server ID** - As role IDs are stored, server ID also will be stored, so bot can apply specific role system fitting with this server
* **Channel ID** - Due to DM monitoring feature, auto scam link detector, and channel permission feature, Channel ID will be saved depending on moderators' decision

Other than these 4 types of data, it's guaranteed that bot will never store them unless there will be needs for developing bot, or implementing new feature to it. It's guaranteed that Role ID, Server ID, Channel ID will be removed from data file once moderators decided to kick this bot from their server. User ID which are stored for managing spamming commands, and preferences will be stored permanently, so that bot can recognize user in other server, in other time.

## Rights to Opt-Out

Server may be using DM monitoring feature, or auto scam link detector of this bot, and users must have right to opt-out from this. Users can opt-out at any time without restrictions, by calling command `p!optout`, so bot won't monitor user's message. However, bot will be able to still detect user's message, and get content of it if they need to (i.e. performing commands). Developer will have responsibilities that bot will never store users' message's contents with any purposes, thus contents will be released after performing commands.

## Underage Users

This Application, Bot follows [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), so developer doesn't allow users whose age is lower than 13 to use this application. As written above, any information about these users will be stored. Developer will remove private information about them as soon as possible if such are found.
