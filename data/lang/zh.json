BCU 한국 서버에도 제대로 된 설치 가이드가 존재하며, 설치 도중 발생할 수 있는 모든 문제를 고려한 해결책 가이들도 같이 구비되어 있습니다. 추가적인 도움 또한 서버가 한글을 주언어로 사용하니 쉽게 다른 유저들로부터 받을 수 있기도 합니다.\n\n서버 링크는 아래와 같습니다 : \n\nhttps://discord.gg/fZZnZsw\n\n__**이 메세지는 친목 유도 및 광고를 위한 메세지가 아님을 유의해 주시길 바랍니다**__\n\n영어 서버 내의 관리자들과 철저한 논의를 통해 결정된 사항이며, 한국 서버 인원 수를 늘린다던지의 목적으로 보내는 메세지가 아닙니다. 또한, 이 서버에 특정한 포스트, 혹은 유튜브 영상을 통해서 들어오셨다면, 그 제작자에게 초대 링크를 영어가 아닌, 한국 서버로 변경할 것을 대신 요청해 주시면 매우 감사하겠습니다\n\n**This message is from BCU English Server**\n\nBot detected that your nickname, or username contains Korean letters, so it assumed that you are from Korea. If you aren't Korean, please ignore this message",
