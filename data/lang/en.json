  "korean_recommend" : "**BCU 서버에 관한 메세지**\n\n닉네임 및 유저 네임에 한글이 있는 것을 봇이 감지하여 이 메세지를 개인 메세지를 통해 보내드립니다. 현재 BCU 영어 서버는 매우 많은 한국인들의 유입으로 약간의 문제를 겪고 있습니다. 디스코드에서 제공해 주는 정보에 따르면 일주일 내 전체 신규 유저들 중 약 70%가 한국인들로 이루어져 있으며, 그 숫자는 지금은 어느정도 감소한 상태이지만 약 2000명에 달했을 정도로 매우 많은 한국인 분들이 들어오고 있습니다.\n\n이러한 과도한 유입이 서버에 안좋은 이유는 유저 수만 계속 증가하고 대부분 비밀번호 시스템 뒤에 막혀 채팅을 못 하고 실질적인 활동량은 그렇게 활발하지 않은, 마치 좀비같이 서버가 존재하게 된다는 점 때문입니다. 비록 유튜브 가이드 등을 통해서 들어오셨겠지만 설치 과정 도중 오류나 문제가 발생하면 언어장벽 때문에 도움을 받기도 어려울 뿐더러, 영어 서버여서 영어를 사용해야 한다는 규칙이 엄격하게 지켜지고 있기 때문에 한글을 쓸 수도 없어서, 영어 실력이 좋지 않다면 유저에게도 별로 좋지 않은 영향이 오게 됩니다.\n\n따라서 해당 문제를 해결하기 위해 봇이 이렇게 한국인분들을 **BCU 한국 서버**로 가이드 하기 위해 메세지를 보내는 중입니다. BCU 한국 서버에도 제대로 된 설치 가이드가 존재하며, 설치 도중 발생할 수 있는 모든 문제를 고려한 해결책 가이들도 같이 구비되어 있습니다. 추가적인 도움 또한 서버가 한글을 주언어로 사용하니 쉽게 다른 유저들로부터 받을 수 있기도 합니다.\n\n서버 링크는 아래와 같습니다 : \n\nhttps://discord.gg/fZZnZsw\n\n__**이 메세지는 친목 유도 및 광고를 위한 메세지가 아님을 유의해 주시길 바랍니다**__\n\n영어 서버 내의 관리자들과 철저한 논의를 통해 결정된 사항이며, 한국 서버 인원 수를 늘린다던지의 목적으로 보내는 메세지가 아닙니다. 또한, 이 서버에 특정한 포스트, 혹은 유튜브 영상을 통해서 들어오셨다면, 그 제작자에게 초대 링크를 영어가 아닌, 한국 서버로 변경할 것을 대신 요청해 주시면 매우 감사하겠습니다\n\n**This message is from BCU English Server**\n\nBot detected that your nickname, or username contains Korean letters, so it assumed that you are from Korea.
