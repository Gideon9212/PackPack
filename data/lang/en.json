To make bot work properly, you have to allow bot to create role, or it won't react to any users\n\nBot needs to add initial role called `PackPackMod` which makes it able to recognize moderators. Usually moderators will have permission to assign roles to themselves, so they need to assign this role. After assigning role, call `p!idset` to modify registered role data such as changing moderator role from `PackPackMod` to your server's real moderator role, and making other normal members able to use commands as well\n\nThis message is from server named **_**, and automatically sent from bot",
