# Privacy Policy

Updated - 2024, July 8th

CardDealer is a Discord Bot whose interface adapts to Users, Channels, and Server according to their (voluntarily specified) needs. To provide customised services, it needs to collect some of its Users' data, if they want to use specific features. This is not a legally binding contract, simply a description of CardDealer's data collection practices. These policies are subject to change, and will be updated if there is any such change.

## Terminology

* **Server** - The Discord server that the User and CardDealer are in.
* **Developer** - The developer of Discord bot, CardDealer. `MandarinSmell#8906 (460409259021172781)`.
* **User** - Anyone in a Server where CardDealer is present, who is using the bot in a channel that it has Read Messages permissions in.
* **Moderator** - A user who has Manage Server permissions in a Server that CardDealer is in.

## Access to Data

Data Access is restricted to the Developer, and will never be used for any purposes besides development, evaluation, or testing. User data will not be sold to any third party. It will not be shared by anyone besides the Developer, unless required by Law or a Terms of Service agreement. Users may request the Developer to show where their data is being stored, and what exactly is being stored. They may also request for their data to be deleted.

## Data Collected By Bot

The datapoints below will be collected by CardDealer, and are critical for it to provide its features. Some of these datapoints will be deleted when the User stops sharing any Server with CardDealer, while others will be stored till CardDealer's End of Service.

* **User ID** - User ID is mandatory to perform inventory feature as well as minor moderation feature regarding modification of them. The Bot also has a capability that once any users send their initial message in the Server, the Bot will create their own inventory, leading to collection of User ID.
* **Role ID** - CardDealer can also perform purchase of roles (with non-real-life currencies related values). To provide this feature to the Users, the Bot needs to store Role ID of the Server. However, the Bot doesn't collect any kinds of roles, but limited to only those which were permitted by Moderators of the Server.
* **Server ID** - Currently, CardDealer functions only in the Servers where permitted by both the Developer and the Moderators of the Server. Main functionalities are for only one Server, and rests Servers are for maintaining of the Bot.
* **Channel ID** - CardDealer performs features that allow the Users to trade the cards (Main feature of CardDealer) each other. To perform this, the Bot must memorize channels where the Users trade, requiring to store Channel IDs.

Besides, these four categories of data, the bot will never store any data. Role IDs, Server ID, and Channel IDs are removed immediately from CardDealer's database when it leaves a Server. User preferences are stored indefinitely, to sync them across servers.

## Rights to Opt-Out

Users can opt out of data collection at any time with `cd.optout`. After this, the bot will not monitor any message from the User. However, bot won't recognize you once command is called. The Developer takes responsibility to ensure that a User's preferences are not collected after they opt out, and they will be removed from the database immediately.
