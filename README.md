# PackPack
BCU pack finding discord bot

When you run [PackBot](https://github.com/battlecatsultimate/PackPack/blob/main/src/main/java/mandarin/packpack/PackBot.java), you have to pass Discord Bot API Token, and Imgur API Access Token as argument

After generating project as jar file
```shell
java -jar PackPack.jar DISCORD_TOKEN IMGUR_TOKEN
```

Plese check [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) site and [Imgur API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/) site to generate your own tokens.

This project uses [Animated Gif Encoder](https://github.com/battlecatsultimate/PackPack/blob/main/src/main/java/mandarin/packpack/supporter/lzw/AnimatedGifEncoder.java) to generate gif from `The Battle Cats` units and enemies.

This project uses [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) to generate mp4 from `The Battle Cats` units and enemies
